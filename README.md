# Smart Text Editor
The text editor that requires only a browser and a keyboard (virtual keyboards as well)!

This is a project that I am working on in my free time, and it has turned into something really useful!
I have started to implement features similar to that of a Progressive Web App, so it can be opened/used through the browser like most websites, or as close to a normal desktop/smartphone/tablet app as possible! I personally find the idea super interesting, so I will continue to learn more about it.

## How to Use
This project can be opened with GitHub Pages, as well as added as a shortcut to your device's desktop, app drawer, toolbar, or home screen!

[Open Smart Text Editor with GitHub Pages](https://offroaders123.github.io/Smart-Text-Editor/Smart%20Text%20Editor.html)

A list of instructions to add a shortcut to your device can be found below:

3. Hover over the "More Tools" option, then select "Create Shortcut"
4. Decide if you would like the site to open in a separate window by checking or not checking the checkbox option
5. A shortcut should now be present on your desktop/app drawer!

5. A shortcut should now be present on your home screen!

### Google Chrome on Android
- I am not able to try this process out myself as I don't have an Android device to test it on, but I have added support for this if you would like to try it out! Any feedback on this would be helpful!
